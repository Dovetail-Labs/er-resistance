        <h1>About this project</h1>
        <p>This project was created by a group of social scientists, citizen scientists, and designers. We want to open up conversations about emotion recognition systems: from the science behind the technology to their social impacts--and everything else in between. Our aim is to promote public understanding of these technologies and citizen involvement in their development and use. </p>
        <p>We are interested in gathering information about people’s experiences of emotion recognition systems and your thoughts on their practical applications in order to further people-centred learning on the topic. This is a participatory knowledge-building exercise -- your perspective matters, and we want to hear your experiences, reflections, reactions and concerns. </p>
        <p>Please don’t hesitate to get in touch if you want to discuss these topics with us in more detail. You can contact us at <a href="mailto:emojifyproject@gmail.com">emojifyproject@gmail.com</a>. </p>
        <p>If you want to keep in touch about the project, join our mailing list <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf4m3o3TeVAjQ9QgbP0wzn_BFmzNUe4jS9npQU4rDMtQkFjNw/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a>.</p>
