  "p1": "This project was created by a group of social scientists, citizen scientists, and designers. We want to open up conversations about emotion recognition systems from the science behind the technology to their social impacts--and everything else in between. Our aim is to promote public understanding of these technologies and citizen involvement in their development and use. We believe that through collective intelligence and sharing perspectives on such important issues, we can empower communities to promote a just and equitable, society.",
