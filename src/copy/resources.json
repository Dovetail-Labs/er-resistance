      "p1": "This project was created by a group of social scientists, citizen scientists, and designers. We want to open up conversations about emotion recognition systems: from the science behind the technology to their social impacts--and everything else in between. Our aim is to promote public understanding of these technologies and citizen involvement in their development and use. ",
      "p2": "We are interested in gathering information about people’s experiences of emotion recognition systems and your thoughts on their practical applications in order to further people-centred learning on the topic. This is a participatory knowledge-building exercise -- your perspective matters, and we want to hear your experiences, reflections, reactions and concerns.",
      "p3": "Please don’t hesitate to get in touch if you want to discuss these topics with us in more detail. You can contact us via this form."
